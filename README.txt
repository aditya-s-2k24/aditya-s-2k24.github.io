## Q2

- Since the questions says "page views" I have taken it to mean that we need to log the "view" event only for the entire page and not individual elements.
- As the questions says the event object should be something like "drop-down, image, text, etc." i have not directly console.log'ed the object, but rather printed out what type of element has been clicked as text.
- To make the output more readable I have used a pipe symbol (|) instead of a comma.

## Q3

- Numbers are not "special characters" or letters.
- Since all analysis on tokens must be performed on dictionary words, the tokenization code handles punctuation but NOT numbers.
- If a number is part of a sequence of alphabets, that sequence is NOT a word.
- A sequence of numbers in not a word.
- The textarea field can scroll to accomodate 10000+ words.
